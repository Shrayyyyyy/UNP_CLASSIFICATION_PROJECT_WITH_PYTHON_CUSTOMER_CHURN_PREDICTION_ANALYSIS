# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_CUSTOMER_CHURN_PREDICTION_ANALYSIS

The Customer Churn Analysis project predicts which customers are likely to leave using machine learning. The dataset from the UCI Iranian Churn Dataset includes 3,150 rows and 14 columns with customer demographics and service details. After handling outliers using the Z-score method and encoding categorical variables, exploratory analysis revealed key churn factors like complaints, subscription length, and usage behavior. Three models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—were tested, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 95% using a 70-30 train-test split. The model helps businesses identify at-risk customers early, improving retention and reducing revenue loss
